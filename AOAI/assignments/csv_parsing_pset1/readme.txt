Implementation of Code:

PART ONE

For accessibility and conciseness, a comprehensive explanation of the code has been detailed in the Jupyter Notebook "csv_reader".

Most of the Code is self contained and does not require changing. You will be guided sequentially through each main 
block of the code. 

Finally, you will reach a cell shown below:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# IMPORTANT: 
Filenames to be imported. MANUALLY UPDATE THE CODE BELOW with the filenames you wish to import.
If more than one filename is given, the program will merge the two DataFrames automatically.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is highlighting where the User is required to manually input the CSV filenames that they wish to ingest and 
produce a Pandas DataFrame with.

Note also that you can view all of the csv files in one go (dataframes will be merged)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Recommendation: To view the initial CSV's simply open the Jupyter Notebook and Run All. You will be able to view all
relevant assignment information relating to the CSV's provided. Then amend the filenames for the hidden CSV's.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


PART TWO

The second part is clearly identified in the code for ease of navigation. Simply run the code and it will produce a
table detailing Averages, Standard Deviation and Min/Max Values 

No Input is required from the User.


PART THREE (of code)

I used visuals to contextualise my data (especially useful for my conclusions in the PDF document). Again, no User input
required. Simply run the code, and it will display key scatter plots and distribution curves.
